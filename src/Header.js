          <p>
            Hey there! 👋 I'm Rasmus, a 4th year Master of Science student in
            Media Technology and Engineering, based in Sweden. I've got a
            passion for computer graphics and web development and when I'm not
            coding, you might just find me at 'Pub Vattentornet', appreciating a
            good beer and catching up with friends. 🍻 My aim here is to keep
            things simple and showcase a glimpse of some of the work I've done
            alone or with friends. Feel free to contact me anytime via my social
            networks. 😊{" "}
