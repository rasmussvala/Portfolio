# My Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, built with React p5 and CSS. The site is hosted on Vercel. It showcases my projects and experiences in [Media Technology and Engineering](https://liu.se/en/education/program/6cmen) as a 4th-year MSc student.

### Key Features:

* **Interactive Header**: The main header is built with p5.js, making it fully interactive. When the mouse hovers over the text, the letters repel dynamically, adding a playful touch.
* **Modular Components**: React's component-based architecture allows projects to be loaded dynamically from a JSON file, allowing seamless updates and additions.
* **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.
